# Basic-Obstacle-Game
An obstacle course game from basic functions in Python.
My main character is a pink rabbit named Cooky and two obstacles are an alien Tata and an alpaca RJ. 
They originated from BT21 Universe of BTS. When Cooky jumps and passes obstacles by using the space key on the keyboard, the player will get 1 point for each jump. 
On the hand, the game is paused if Cooky can not pass.
